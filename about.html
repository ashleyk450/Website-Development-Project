        Hi, I’m Ashley King. I’m currently pursuing a degree in Software
        Development and plan to minor in Cybersecurity. I’m interested in
        building secure, reliable software and understanding how systems work
        behind the scenes.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy problem-solving and learning new technologies, especially when
        it involves figuring out how systems can be improved or made more secure.
        With a background in healthcare, I’ve developed strong attention to
        detail and adaptability, and I’m excited to continue growing my skills
        in both software development and cybersecurity.
